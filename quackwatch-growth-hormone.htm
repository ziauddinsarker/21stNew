						<span class="toplinks">Shady HGH industry vendors take
					  advantage of quick profits</span></p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">We at 21st Century HGH will be
					  the first to admit that the HGH industry is very shady. Our
					  biggest problem comes from the &quot;HGH Releaser&quot; vendors who sell a
					  few pennies worth of amino acids at a price close to those of us
					  selling real human growth hormone. Since their profit margins are so much higher
					  than ours they have the financial capacity to market their
					  products in ways we can't afford. They do radio, TV, print
					  media, and end up in high positions on the search engines. They
					  can afford it. Their profit is great and their marketing pitch
					  is very shrill. We get their dissatisfied customers all the
					  time.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Again, we at 21st Century HGH
					  will be the first to admit that pharmaceutical human growth hormone, purchased
					  through a doctor with a prescription, and injected into the body,
					  is the superior way to get the substance into your system. But the results
					  you get from our homeopathic  oral spray, at a reasonable
					  cost, without sticking yourself with needles, seems to us to be a
					  reasonable way to get human growth hormone into your system. We are not at odds
					  with doctors pushing  injections. We think the
					  consumer should make an educated choice.</p>
					<p align="left" class="toplinks">Alarmist nature of
					  Quackwatch and Drug Companies</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">To begin, the consumer should
					  recognize the first truth of the media: &quot;Sex Sells!&quot; Look at all
					  the major media outlets from TV to Music to Movies to News, &quot;sex
					  sells.&quot; The more outrageous and the more alarmist (&quot;sexy&quot;) news
					  can be, the more it attracts an audience. So when a
				  &quot;credentialed&quot; doctor writes an article for a publication that
					  purportedly is &quot;protecting&quot; the consumer, the more they can scare
					  you, the better.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Quackwatch, in our opinion,
					  would be more viable, believable, and credible, if they weren't
					  pushing their own drugs. If they were really &quot;protecting the
					  consumer&quot; from quacks and fakes, they would bring to bear their
					  own scientific evidence why &quot;HGH releasers&quot; fail after a month,
					  or why homeopathic remedies are not considered mainstream. But
					  they don't do this. They make no clear arguments preferring,
					  instead, to make simple pronouncements and to use scare tactics.
					  They scare you with old information about the worst schisters in
					  the industry. They hide the truth about the problems of their
					  own drugs and mislead you about the illegality of homeopathic
					  remedies. Sex sells! Buyer beware.</p>
					<p align="left" class="toplinks">A lot is truthful but
					  outdated.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Doctor Barrett brought up
					  factual information about the 3 companies that were convicted 5
					  years ago. He sited the worst offenders in the industry.
					  There are over 300 vendors selling &quot;HGH&quot; products, some legit,
					  others less so. Dr. Barrett chose to highlight the bottom 1% of
					  the industry. We'd like to ask Dr. Barrett, &quot;How many doctors
					  are sued for malpractice every year? 1%? More?&quot;</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Dr. Barrett brought forth
					  information that was adjudicated many years ago. Since that time
					  the Federal Trade Commission has cleaned up a lot of the
					  industry. All vendors of human growth hormone products were sent letters
					  informing them of what &quot;claims&quot; can and cannot be made. Most
					  vendors complied. Some have not. We can advise you that many of
					  those vendors who have complied the least come up very high in
					  Yahoo and MSN searches. Not so in Google searches. Don't ask us
					  why because we don't know.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">The FDA monitors the labels of
					  most homeopathic  oral sprays and shuts down those companies
					  that label their products using the descriptive term
				  &quot;nanograms.&quot; This is illegal.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Dr. Barrett also conveniently
					  omitted information about the lawsuit brought against the
					  pharmaceutical company Genentech, who agreed to pay a criminal
					  fine and restitution in the amount of $50 million, because they
					  promoted human growth hormone for a medical use that was not approved
					  by the FDA. This company manufactured it specifically for
					  doctors prescribing injections. Look who's calling the
					  kettle black! And what about this front page story in the
					  September 18, 2006 issue of USA today entitled <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-09-17-unapproved-drugs-cover_x.htm"> &quot;Hundreds of unapproved drugs sold by
						prescription.&quot;</a></p>
					<p align="left" class="toplinks">HGH Homeopathics vs.
					  Allopathics</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Allopathic medicine is what
					  doctors practice. Homeopathic remedies are what naturopaths
					  prescribe. The former involves the universe of drugs and the
					  latter involves the universe of natural products. Although both
					  are relatively large industries, nutritional products are dwarfed
					  by the sheer size of the pharmaceutical industry. It is big, big
					  business. These industries depend on allopathic physicians to
					  push their drugs. There is no doubt about the potency of these
					  pharmaceutical products (just read the warning labels!). But are
					  they all necessary and are they the only answer?</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Most (including well known
					  radio doctor Dean Adelle), though not all, allopathic physicians
					  will tell you that all homeopathic products are useless. They
					  simply roll up over 150 years of all natural remedies that have
					  helped millions of people through time and say it's bunk. In the
					  case of HGH, IGF-1 levels (the result of an increase in HGH) can
					  be measured. These levels rise in many people who use
					  homeopathic HGH. How more <b><i>objective</i></b> can you
					  get?</p>
					<p align="left" class="toplinks">IGF-1 Testing</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Here's the rub: There is no
					  motivation for any <b><i>independent agency</i></b> to do
					  comparative IGF-1 testing on all the various HGH products on the
					  market today. So the consumer has no basis for independent,
					  objective, comparison of products. Basically, you just have to
					  rely on the &quot;claims&quot; of the vendors.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Blood tests to measure IGF-1
					  levels are very expensive. Your doctor can do them for you for
					  $500-$800. pharmaceutical companies have had to do this testing
					  to gain FDA approval. We did our own private testing of IGF-1
					  levels on people using our product to make sure it worked prior
					  to selling it to the general public. But honestly, if we tested
					  5 people or 50 people or 5,000 people, would it be wise for you
					  to really believe the results of a test we did on our own
					  product? If I were a consumer I certainly would not. The claims
					  other companies make about the effectiveness of their product we
					  take with a huge grain of salt.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">We would gladly put our product
					  up for independent evaluation testing against all other products
					  on the market today. But who would do it and why? Again,
					  there's the rub. We know what the results would show:
					  pharmaceutical injections gets the best results, &quot;releasers&quot; decline
					  markedly after one month, and homeopathic oral sprays continue to
					  show 60%-80% of the same rise in IGF-1 levels of injections. We'd love for an
					  independent agency to do the tests and prove us right or
					  wrong!</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">We know how homeopathic
					  remedies work. We know that there is only one recipe that gets
					  the body to respond the way we want. More HGH in the recipe
					  makes the product less potent just as less of it in the product
					  makes it less potent. There is only one recipe that works and
					  all legitimate homeopathic oral sprays are generic and
					  identical. (Some may add a little &quot;male this&quot; or &quot;female that&quot;
					  to goose up the price of their product or make it more &quot;special,&quot;
					  i.e. more marketable).</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Again, we come back to the same
					  conclusion offered in our &quot;Our bottom line:&quot;: Invest $60 bucks
					  and see for yourself. Neither an allopathic nor naturopathic
					  specialist can tell you in advance if it will work for you or
					  not. If it does nothing get a complete refund. If it does
					  something it's the best investment you've ever made in your
					  entire life! Exactly what have you got to lose?</p>
