    <p align="left" class="bodytext">Human growth hormone is
      produced in the pituitary gland is secreted throughout a person's
      lifetime. It promotes growth in children and plays an important
      role in adult metabolism. It was first isolated in 1956 and its
      structure was identified in 1972. Until the mid-1980s the only
      source of HGH was from pituitary glands collected post mortem.
      Today it is available in larger quantities through the technique
      of genetic engineering and a number of conditions apart from the
      classical  insufficiency can be treated. Human
      growth hormone is the master hormone produced by the master
      gland, the pituitary, which rests just behind our eyes. HGH acts
      as a catalyst for many glandular secretions and life functions
      critical to maintaining youth. It's the stuff that makes nearly
      every cell in our bodies grow and repair over the course of our
      lives.</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="toplinks"><b>FAQ: How Does this oral  spray work?</b></span><b><a name="Howdoes" id="Howdoes"></a></b></p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext">21st Century HGH allows you to
      access the benefits of human growth hormone through a safe and
      effective oral spray at a fraction of the cost of injections. It
      works with your body on a cellular level to gently bring about
      positive, lasting changes over time, without undesirable long
      term side effects.Our oral spray works because it supports a
      powerful physiological response and feedback communication to the
      pituitary gland, thereby assisting to gradually and naturally
      enhance its  capacities. There are no Human Growth Hormone side effects using homeopathic oral sprays.</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="toplinks"><b>FAQ: What is human growth hormone
      used for?</b></span><b><a name="Itsuse" id="Itsuse"></a></b></p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext">Until 1988 human growth hormone
      was used exclusively to treat patients with growth hormone
      insufficiency due to the limited supply of the substance. Since
      it can now be produced in great quantities at reasonable costs
      it is now being used in a wide range of indications.
      Growth hormone in humans after the age of 21 to 31 falls about
      14% per decade, so that the total 24-hour
      production rate is reduced in half by the age of 60. In numerical
      values, we produce on a daily basis about 500 micrograms at 20
      years old, 200 micrograms at 40 years, and 25 micrograms at 80
      years old. So the total daily  secretion is constantly
      declining in humans with increasing age. Levels considered
  &quot;Elderly&quot; are often reached by  35-40! And after age 65, about
      half the population is partially or wholly deficient in growth
      hormone.</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="toplinks"><b>FAQ: What age is appropriate to
      use this product?</b></span><b><a name="Whatage" id=
"Whatage"></a></b></p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext">Our oral spray should not be
      used by anyone under 21 years old. As intelligent individuals,
      each one of us must decide this for him or herself. But if you're
      over 30 and experiencing problems that didn't exist 10 years ago,
      maybe these problems are associated with decreased levels of
      human growth hormone in your blood. By 30 years old that level is about
      one third of what it used to be at  18 years old. For most people the
      age of 18 was a time when we took our health for granted. But by
      the time we reach 30 we may be overweight, lacking energy, etc.
      With decreasing levels  as we age, is it a wonder things
      seem to get worse with time? The following table displays the
      normal level of HGH in the body measured in nanograms/milliliter
      of blood. As you can see, there is a dramatic difference between
      that of an 18 year old and anyone older than 30 (1000 vs.325).
      It's no wonder we start going downhill in our 30's.<br />
       Normal Level<br />
       18- 1000<br />
       20- 775<br />
       25- 500<br />
       30- 375<br />
       35- 325<br />
       40- 300<br />
       85- 225</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext">After  30 it's never too
      soon to start taking human growth hormone. Both men and women
      report gains in energy levels, and an overall sense of well
      being. Younger adults, especially bodybuilders and athletes of
      all kinds can benefit from taking this product. And there are no   side effects using homeopathic oral sprays..</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="toplinks"><b>FAQ: What's the difference
      between  injections and oral sprays?</b></span><b><a name=
"Whatsthediff" id="Whatsthediff"></a></b></p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext">The main difference between
      injectable HGH and homeopathic HGH is the speed in which each
      work. There are no clinical studies that equate the effects of
      injectible HGH and homeopathic sprays. The homeopathic route
      takes longer, is safer, and much less
      expensive. Medical experts agree that effects  are normally
      felt between weeks 4-8, with the most dramatic ones occurring
      over time. The body takes time to start reversing conditions
      which have existed for years. A two month trial period is the
      best time frame to commit to but many notice positive changes in
      the first month. Our product is sprayed under the tongue and
      has no taste. Have patience! Your growth hormone levels may have
      been low for years. If your receptor sites are blocked, it could
      take time for your body to respond in a positive manner. If you
      smoke, drink, fail to exercise and/or have a poor diet, the
      results you desire may take longer. You should also be aware that
      at certain times the body may shift into &quot;neutral&quot; and some
      results may seem to diminish, or vanish altogether. If you
      experience this, your body may be using growth hormone to rebuild
      tissue or, to a degree, may be resting. In &quot;The Leading Edge for
      Anti-Aging,&quot; Dr. H.A. Davis, Ph.D, states,  &quot;Different
      people notice different results with homeopathic human growth
      hormone. Some people see immediate, dramatic results, while
      others experience more subtle benefits. With proper diet and
      exercise, the results can be faster, deeper, and more pronounced.
      Many people have begun a whole new life on hormone replacement
      therapy.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="toplinks"><b>FAQ: What's the difference
      between stacked amino secretogogues and  oral sprays?</b></span><b><a name=
"Diffstacked" id="Diffstacked"></a></b></p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext">Pills are mostly processed into
      waste by the intestinal tract whereas the  molecule goes
      directly into the bloodstream with oral sprays. Pills do
      stimulate your own Pituitary Gland into producing additional HGH but there
      are reports that after several months the Pituitary Gland may
      cease it's stimulation and therefore the extra production. Oral sprays go directly into
      the bloodstream without affecting the Pituitary Gland.</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="toplinks"><b>FAQ: Are there any negative side
      effects using  therapies?</b></span><b><a name="Sideeffects" id=
"Sideeffects"></a></b></p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext">There has been concern that
      those taking stacked amino secretagogues develop the side effect
      of developing unhealthy amounts of cortisol in the body which
      doesn't occur via our homeopathic product. Human growth hormone has been shown
      in some studies to have side effects which include carpal tunnel
      syndrome, arthritis and edema. However, this was experienced only
      when high dose injections were given. Studies have shown that
      these side effects can be avoided by slow initial administration,
      proper monitoring of levels, and administration on a daily basis
      in what is called a &quot;low-dose, high frequency&quot; method. Our product is a low dose, homeopathic preparation administered
      by under the tongue. There have been no studies showing
      negative side effects with homeopathic oral sprays.</p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext"><span class="toplinks"><b>FAQ: Anything else I should know
      about your  product?</b></span><b><a name="Anythingelse" id=
"Anythingelse"></a></b></p>
    <p align="left" class="bodytext">You never know what you've got until it's gone.
      Many users  get to feeling so great and &quot;normal&quot; after six
      months that they stop using the product. Soon thereafter the old
      &quot;symptoms of slowing down&quot; start creeping right back in. You'll
      realize what you've lost and get right back on the product again.
      Then, you'll never be without it!</p>
