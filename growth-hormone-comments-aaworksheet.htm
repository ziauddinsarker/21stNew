He earned the title ‘Most Hated Man in Tennis’ when he turned in fellow player,  Daniel Koellerer, for using HGH, which resulted in a lifetime ban for Koellerer and a reduced penalty for Odesnik.  It’s become clear that HGH is common in sports.

					<p><span class="bodytext">8/12/14 - It's a familiar story by now: a professional athlete was suspended this week for violating his sport's illegal substances policy. What's different about this story? It's not a Major League Baseball Player. Instead, the player in question was an NFL cornerback for the Dallas Cowboys, Orlando Scandrick. The kicker: he's not the only player to face a suspension in recent days, either. Why are NFL players suddenly facing media scrutiny over banned substances? And what role does the NFL and the NFLPA's refusal to enact new drug testing policies, over the difficulty of testing for Human Growth Hormone, have to play in all this? <a href="http://www.21stcenturyhgh.com/blog/are-you-ready-for-some-ped-football-suspensions/"><em>read more</em></a></span></p>

Baseball players who were involved in steroid and other PED scandals. On the eve of voting for the induction of 2014's nominees, the Baseball Hall of Fame announced a rule change that seems innocuous, but could have a big impact on players who chose drug use over baseball. Now it seems the only way some of baseball's most well-known players of recent years will get a ticket to Cooperstown is if they pay for it, just like the rest of us. <a href="http://www.21stcenturyhgh.com/blog/baseball-hall-of-fame-rule-change-keeps-dopers-out/"><em>read more</em></a></span></p>

A recent spate of offenders who are still making their mark on the sport of baseball, including the Orioles Nelson Cruz, former All-Star Manny Ramirez, and the Milwaukee Brewers Ryan Braun, would make it seem so. Is it really a case of fans and teams letting bygones be bygones, or is baseball letting players get away with bad behavior? <a href="http://www.21stcenturyhgh.com/blog/are-major-league-baseball-players-rewarded-despite-ped-use/"><em>read more</em></a></span></p>

If you are a fan of the World Cup, you know that this term means soccer to the rest of the world, not the familiar pigskin game we refer to here in the States, and the 2014 match ups have the news and social media going soccer-crazy. One thing maybe only die-hard fans are aware of is the fact that professional soccer is one of the "cleanest" sports out there, thanks to the vigilance of their governing body, FIFA.

The official explanation for A Rod's decision is so that he can focus on preparing for his (triumphant?) return to the Yankees lineup in 2015. However, others who have been burned by A Rod's endless drama and secrets feel that the move is just a ploy to help him get access to the remaining money on his contract. Only time will tell if the final chapter in A Rod's story will be like The Comeback Kid . . . or The Fall Guy. <a href="http://www.21stcenturyhgh.com/blog/a-rods-last-dropped-lawsuit-begs-the-question-can-he-play-clean-in-2015/"><em>read more</em></a></span></p>

					<p><span class="bodytext">5/11/14 - Just when we thought it was safe to discuss baseball again, the scandal that won't quit rears its head. Just last week, the police detective in the Florida Biogenesis case released a report, including documents and audio interviews, that conclude despite all the denials from Major League Baseball, it's strongly believed that MLB officials and investigators knew they were buying stolen documents in their pursuit of Alex Rodriguez. MLB officials hoped they could prove he took illegal performance enhancers, including testosterone and HGH, sold to him by Anthony Bosch's Biogenesis clinic. It's just another piece of the Biogenesis puzzle that shows that for the players, officials, fans, and anyone who got caught up in what has become the biggest scandal in baseball history, there really are no winners. <a href="http://www.21stcenturyhgh.com/blog/the-scandel-that-wont-rest-new-biogenesis-news/"><em>read more</em></a></span></p>

					<p><span class="bodytext">5/5/14 - Sports injuries are a "pain" to athletes, in more ways than one. Aside from the physical discomfort, there's the loss of training time, the inability to complete daily tasks like you did without the injury, and in extreme cases, the possibility of dealing with a chronic or recurring condition, and even surgery. The newest research into how the body works suggests that Human Growth Hormone plays a bigger role in healing from injury than we ever thought possible, which is why so many pro athletes are caught using HGH when they experience significant injuries.

While the likelihood of a cure for aging is the stuff science fiction is made of, there is significant evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that there is a substance that can treat the "symptoms" of the disease of aging, and in fact essentially turn back the hands of time.

While there are people out there that are hoping all this testing and implementing of PED policies can return us to "the good ole days" of good, clean competition, there's a downside to it as well.

					<p class="bodytext">Hi,</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I was surfing the net, as I usually do and found your ad about your hgh product. I am 59 years old and I work out with resistance training in the gym 4-5 days every week, so I am in generally good condition. However, I do want to lose some of the hard to lose fat around the midsection.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I take various supplements and vitamins, and I do a lot of research on what is effective and beneficial, and what is not. I always look for the ingredients of a product, and I typically shy away from products that do not list the ingredients and how much of each, or products that list &quot;Proprietary Blend&quot; on the ingredient label. As well, I try to research various medical reports about the different ingredients, to see which are beneficial and what the clinical doses being used for a particular study result.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">On a whim, I am currently using the product &quot;Sytropin&quot; oral spray. because it had some good ingredients, but unfortunately did not list the dose amounts of each. I have read many times about the benefits of using an HGH product. I have also read reports about how injected HGH over time, tends to shut down the pituitary glands ability to naturally produce HGH, rendering an individual dependent on the monthly injections. So I have stayed with HGH precursor/booster products rather than actual HGH or synthetic HGH. </p>
					<p class="bodytext">I was reading about your product, and it seems like it would be worth trying. However, I would like to know, being that it contains a synthetic HGH as claimed in your ad, will it too have an adverse effect on the natural production of HGH by the pituitary gland?</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Just so you know, I do NOT take any kind of steroids, and very rarely use pro-hormones.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I realize, you will tend to promote your product, but I am hoping you will address my concerns honestly without being overly biased towards your product. Your answer will determine if I decide to try your product or not, and as well promote it to other members of the gym I go to...</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Thank very much for your time and patience, I will look forward to your reply.<br />

					  <span class="style14">I have also read reports about how injected HGH over time, tends to shut down the pituitary glands ability to naturally produce HGH, rendering an individual dependent on the monthly injections. So I have stayed with HGH precursor/booster products rather than actual HGH or synthetic HGH. </span></p>
					<p class="bodytext">All HGH is &quot;synthetic,&quot; created in a lab. You would have to take HGH injections for a very long time for it to &quot;shut down&quot; the pituitary capacity to produce it. What often happens with the injections is that when it is put into the body from the outside the pituitary sees no need to produce any. When the injections are stopped the pituitary goes back to it's normal production, depending on the age of the person. </p>
					<p class="bodytext">Actually, the precursor/boosters have more of a dampening effect on the pituitary than injections. That's why vendors usually recommend &quot;cycling&quot; on and off the product in order to give the pituitary a &quot;rest.&quot; Precursors like Sytropin &quot;tickle&quot; the pituitary to create more HGH which it does quite successfully. The downside is that the body gets used to this tickle and 4-8 weeks later it stops producing the invigorating results. It's a terrible tease…getting the benefits and then all of a sudden it's gone. We get Sytropin users coming to us all the time.</p>
					<p class="style14">I was reading about your product, and it seems like it would be worth trying. However, I would like to know, being that it contains a synthetic HGH as claimed in your ad, will it too have an adverse effect on the natural production of HGH by the pituitary gland?</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Our product contains the same pharmaceutical synthetic HGH that's used in injections. But our product is homeopathic (do some research on &quot;homeopathy&quot; and you'll understand better). Our product contains just enough HGH, in a homeopathic preparation, to make the liver believe there is increased HGH in the system so as to trick it into producing an increase in IGF-1, which it does. It's the IGF-1, not HGH, that brings the invigoration properties. So our product has very little impact on the pituitary. You can take it forever without &quot;cycling.&quot;</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Hope this answers your concerns. We appreciate your business!</p>
					<p class="bodytext">21stcenturyhgh.com</p>
					<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Thank you for your response to my concerns about your product. YES&lt; I will do some research on the term Homeopathy. The term is not foreign to me, however, it would do me well to further understand it.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I do understand the relationship between HGH and IGF-1, Insulin-like Growth Factor-1. I will say however, that I have not read any such warning made by Sytropin that it should be cycled. On the other hand, I have been taking it for awhile now, and do not realize the same benefits as in the beginning, so maybe there is something there to think about.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I should say, I can be a hard sell, as I rarely accept anything just because someone said this or that. As well, I always read advertisements with skepticism, and I have learned there are times when advertised testimonials have been misleading at best, and outright dishonest at worst.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Please do NOT misunderstand me, I am NOT saying you or the advertisements about your product are doing this. I spend a lot of time in the gym, and I speak to many other guys there about various supplements they use, tried and stopped using, and so on. Anecdotal information when it comes from people you know, and see regularly, is very powerful testimony to a particular product's value. Of course I realize, what works for one person, is not a guarantee it is will work as good for someone else or at all for that matter. </p>
					<p class="bodytext">To be honest, I have not talked to anyone about using your product, so I don't know through such anecdotal information how well it works. But sometimes, as I have done on more than one occasion, just have to try the stuff for myself. The problem is, as I spend a lot  of time in the gym, I would be interested in the advanced formula, and that is quite expensive, just to try and then find out it might not work for me. I am not saying it wouldn't work, but without knowing anyone who uses it, there is just no way for me to know. I spend a lot of money on vitamins and supplements, so the overall cost is not as much of a problem, if I knew it worked for me.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Anyway, have a great day, and thanks once again for your reply..</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Sincerely,<br />

					<p class="bodytext">We don't really advertise so we are not quite sure how you found us. Having said that, whenever I shop online for any product I never believe online testimonials, either positive or negative. They are 90% made up, including the &quot;doctors&quot; who back the products. What I do first is look for the time the company has been in business which can be discovered by looking up the age of the website (public information). If they've been in business a while that's a good sign. Second, I call or email. If I get a response, that's another good sign. And third, I look for a guarantee. When an online company passes those three tests it says a lot more to me as a consumer than a pageful of testimonials. </p>
					<p class="style14">I realize, what works for one person, is not a guarantee it is will work as good for someone else or at all for that matter.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">This is especially true for homeopathic products. That's why we offer a full 90 day no-questions-asked refund guarantee. 2% of the population just doesn't respond to homeopathy of any kind (be it HGH, the flu, allergies, etc.), and no one seems to know why. So if someone asks for a refund, we issue one right away (after all the bottles, new and used, are shipped back to us). Over 13 years refunds have averaged only .005% (one half of one percent) of our gross sales, so it's not a big deal to us.</p>

					<p class="bodytext">Hello,</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I have recently ordered your product.  But awaiting shipping I was looking into similar products that are available at our local  nutritional store.   I am really confused as to how much HGH - IGF-1 and IGF2 that the spray has?  How many  MG am I getting of each ingredient?</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I purchased the HGH advanced formula, and it  says HGH 30X, deer antler 6X and liver extract 3 X.  I am trying to compare it to see if I am getting acceptable amounts of the HGH versus trying to go to the doctor for injections.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">The web site says I am getting real HGH same as the doctors, so what is the difference in amounts that I would get per serving, versus one injection?  Is the amount of HGH the same or similar?</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Please let me know.  This is very important.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Janice<br />
					  Bryn Mawr, PA</p>
					<p class="style10">We get this question all the time and it's basically unanswerable as you've expressed it. You should do some research on homeopathy and you will understand better. Quickly stated, homeopathy is a science of remedies that's been around for over 200 years curing many maladies like allergies, the flu, menopausal symptoms, etc. </p>
					<p class="style10">Our product is a homeopathic preparation that contains real HGH. There is only one homeopathic recipe that gets the product to increase your IGF-1 levels. It's not the HGH that gives you the invigoration properties but the IGF-1 created by the liver that gives you what you are looking for. If we added more HGH to our recipe the product would not trigger your liver to produce more IGF-1 than it does with the current recipe. It's counter-intuitive but that's how homeopathy works. </p>
					<p class="style10">Our product gets 60%-80% of the same rise in IGF-1 levels that you would get by taking injections. Pills or sprays that don't contain any HGH work well for only 4-6 weeks and then stop working altogether. </p>
					<p class="style10">We suggest you use our spray for at least a month or two. If you are not happy for any reason just send it back for a complete refund. That way you'll be able to see for yourself if the product works rather than getting knocked around by the next sales pitch.</p>

					  <p align="left"> <span class="bodytext">I am seeking a new supplier of HGH sublingual which I have been using for at least 6 months. I have had 6 major surgeries with my large intestine removed and a spastic bladder which died and I have resuscitated through the use of Deer Antler Spray IGF-1 and HGH whose ingredients are a combination of IGF -1 Deer Antler spray and IGF-2. The product is distributed by Newtropin and is alcohol based.</span></p>
					  <p align="left"><span class="bodytext">        I have been satisfied by the product I am using but not with Newtropin itself.</span></p>
					  <p align="left"><span class="bodytext">        Your HGH products do not contain IGF-1 nor IGF-2. I am looking for a product that has those ingredients but maybe you can explain why I should use your product by phone or email.</span></p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Thank you,</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Alan</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style10">We couldn't find the ingredients of Newtropin IGF-1 IGF-2 anywhere on their website. This is always a bad sign. What are they hiding? After finding the ingredients at dailymed we discovered that there is no IGF-2 in the product, which doesn't surprise us. In addition, the listing of their ingredients seems to violate many of the new FDA regulations for labeling. No sense in spending any more of our time on any comparison.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style10">We've been selling homeopathic HGH for 14 years. We must be doing something right. Many companies selling the product are giving up because of the numerous hoops the FDA is making vendors jump through. It's becoming not worth the time.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style10">Contrary to what you said in your email, our Advanced Formula HGH product does contain real pharmaceutical HGH and IGF-1 in the form of Deer Antler (Oleum Animale, the FDA forbids the "deer antler" description). We don't hide our ingredients as we have an "Ingredients" tab at the top of every page on our website: http://www.21stcenturyhgh.com/growth-hormone-ingredients.htm  We know what IGF-2 is, but know of no substance that mimics it.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="style10">You should try our product. You can research forever but there is nothing like personally trying it for yourself. We have a 90 day complete money back guarantee, no questions asked (just send used and unused bottles back). We pride ourselves on our customer service (we respond back to emails and phone messages within 24 hours, most vendors do not).</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Thank you for getting back to me quickly. I am glad to be disengaging with Newtropin who I tried to form a business relationship with and found their ethics to be less than I require.</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">So tell me, what is the derivative of your HGH product? Is that proprietary information? I am just curious as to how this product works.        </p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Alan</p>
					  <p align="left" class="style10">All HGH comes from the same place, synthetically produced in the lab. Eli Lilly and Genentech are the largest manufacturers.</p>
