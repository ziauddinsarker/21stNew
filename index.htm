							<p class="header2">Gentle, Homeopathic oral spray gets real results!</p>
							<p class="bodytext">See for yourself.</p>
							<p class="bodytext"> <strong>COMPLETE MONEY BACK GUARANTEE! <span class="style8">*</span></strong></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="bodytext">Many Hollywood performers take advantage of youth restoring human growth hormone therapy as do athletes, musicians, and artists for its performance enhancing abilities. They can afford the doctor's care, the prescriptions, and have a greater motivation to suffer through injections. But homeopathic HGH oral sprays are approved by the FDA for over the counter sales, are much less expensive than injections, and achieve 60%-80% of the same results of the expensive therapies. If the everyday person is looking for an invigoration product, this is it!</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Human Growth Hormone is the main hormone trigger of your entire body, telling your body to replace cells that die on a daily basis. As you go through life, your body circulates less and less growth hormone, replacing fewer cells, and so our body &quot;ages.&quot; Young people, with great amounts of growth hormone circulating in their system, have the capacity to replace these lost cells easily.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Using our homeopathic spray puts human growth hormone back into your system, triggering the liver to produce IGF-1, the substance that provides the invigoration properties. You can explore more about HGH by clicking on the links below and we hope you find our delivery straight forward and simple to understand.</p>
						<p align="center" class="bodytext"><a href="current-state-of-hgh.htm">The Current State of HGH Supplementation Today</a></p>
						<p class="bodytext">You'll notice we make no outrageous claims on this website about the benefits of increasing the amount of this primary hormone into your system. We know the reality is that everyone reacts in different ways depending on age, size, and activity level. So we can't know exactly how it will help you. But we can tell you this: most people who buy our homeopathic oral spray for one or two specific reasons soon discover that it helps them in many other, unanticipated ways.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">The downside of purchasing human growth hormone in the USA is that there are over 300 companies selling &quot;HGH&quot; (notice the quotes!) all claiming to be &quot;the best.&quot; However, there are only about 30 selling sprays that actually contain real human growth hormone. So the consumer has a 90% chance of buying a product that contains none (see a list of just a few of the 270 vendors on the right). You can't put HGH into a pill. So any company selling pills is selling only pills, not real growth hormone. Make sure to read the ingredients. Any variation such as &quot;HGHr,&quot; &quot;HGH components,&quot; etc., is not the real thing. Be smart.</p>
						<p class="bodytext">Our oral spray is the best HGH and is easy to use. Just two sprays under the tongue three times per day will do it. The two most important times are right before you go to sleep and right when you wake up so most people keep the bottle on their nightstand. Then spray once more any time of day. It's the &quot;extra&quot; dose so if you miss it its no big deal. One bottle is a one month's supply. After about 3 months you can drop the third dose because you are fully saturated. This will enable each bottle to last 50% longer. Don't use greater doses. It won't hurt you but you'll be wasting it. You're gonna love this product!</p>
						<p class="bodytext"><span class="style8">*</span>Our Guarantee If you are not completely satisfied within 90 days of your purchase we will refund your total purchase price, no questions asked. Simply return all used and unused bottles. We appreciate your business!</p>

						<p>What about pills like GHR1000? They don't work. Actually they do. But only for about a month. Then the body gets used to the pituitary tickle provided by the amino acids and stops the additional production. To experience the benefits only to have them suddenly disappear is a cruel tease! Sprays with real HGH are the only way to go.</p>

						<p>Some companies, like Sytropin, put what's in a pill into a spray. So buyer beware. They'll say their product contains "HGH components," like a go-kart with 2 axles, 4 tires, and a steering wheel contains "automobile components." Some companies will even put what's in a pill into a liquid for injection. It's an amazing industry!</p>

						<p>Beware of Internet "review" websites. Many will write reviews knocking down the competition and then magically recommend only the brands they earn commissions on.

I took it because it contained the real stuff as compared to other products. It has helped my body regulate changes associated with getting older. It made my skin smoother (less wrinkles), it helped me to sleep better. And, made me look and feel younger....I will definitely continue to use this outstanding life changing oral spray!"</p>

They answered all my questions quickly by email and by telephone and shipped my order the next day as promised. It's taken about a month but I'm noticing improvements in areas I hadn't expected. Other companies try to trick you into thinking their product has the real growth hormone in it when it doesn't. This product actually contains real pharmaceutical growth hormone, the best HGH. I'll be buying again."</p>
