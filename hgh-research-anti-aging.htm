					  </span><span class="bodytext"><b>Normal
						Changes in the Growth Hormone Axis with
						Aging</b><br />
						The rate of HGH secretion from the anterior pituitary is highest
						around puberty, and declines progressively thereafter. This
						age-related decline in HGH secretion involves a number of changes
						in the HGH axis, including decreased serum levels of insulin-like
						growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and decreased secretion of growth
						hormone-releasing HGH from the hypothalamus. The cause of the
						normal age-related decrease in this secretion is not well
						understood, but is thought to result, in part, from increased
						secretion of somatostatin, the GH-inhibiting hormone.<br />
				  <br />
						Normal aging is accompanied by a number of catabolic effects,
						including a decrease in lean mass, increase in fat mass, and
						decrease in bone density. Associated with these physiologic
						changes is a clinical picture often referred to as the
						somatopause: frailty, muscle atrophy, relative obesity, increased
						frequency of fractures and disordered sleep. These clinical signs
						of aging are, without doubt, the manifestation of a very complex
						set of changes which involve, at least in part, the GH-axis.
						Naturally, this has spurred considerable interest in
						administering supplemental HGH as a &quot;treatment&quot; for aging in
						humans, and the availability of recombinant HGH has made
						such studies feasible.<br />
				  <br />
						In contrast to the view that growth hormone deficiency contributes to the
						aging phenomenon, there is information suggesting that normal or
						high levels of growth hormone may accelerate aging. Mice with genetic
						dwarfism due to deficiency in human growth hormone, prolactin and
						thyroid-stimulating hormone live considerably longer than normal
						mice, and the increased levels seen with acromegaly in
						humans are associated with reduced life expectancy. Both of these
						findings are likely due to metabolic effects of human growth hormone.<br />
				  <br />
				  <b>HGH Replacement Therapy in HGH-deficient Adults for
					anti-aging</b><br />
						Adult-onset HGH deficiency in humans is almost always due to
						pituitary disease, usually from a tumor or therapeutic efforts to
						treat a tumor. Such patients have increased risk of death from
						cardiovascular disease, and, relative to age-matched controls,
						show increased fat mass, reduced muscle mass and strength, lower
						bone density, and higher serum lipid concentrations.
						Additionally, they suffer from reduced vigor, sexual dysfunction
						and emotional problems.<br />
				  <br />
						More than a dozen clinical trials have sought to evaluate human growth hormone
						replacement in patients with adult-onset deficiency. The goal has
						usually been to normalize serum IGF-1 concentrations by daily
						injections. In essentially all cases, several months of replacement therapy led to increased lean mass and decreased
						adiposity (especially in visceral fat). The effects of HGH on bone density and hyperlipidemia has been
						inconsistent or minor, as have been the effects on strength and
						mental abilities. Common side effects observed in these trials
						included edema and joint/muscle pain, which appeared related to
						dose of growth hormone. Since the first of these trials was conducted in
						1988, long term risks are not yet known.<br />
				  <br />
				  <b>HGH Therapy in the Elderly</b>&nbsp;<br />
						Long before Ponce de Leon went in search of the legendary
						fountain of youth, people sought treatments to prevent or reverse
						the effects of aging. In 1990, considerable interest was
						generated from a report by Rudman and colleagues which described
						wonderful effects of HGH in a small group of elderly
						males. These volunteers, who ranged in age from 61 to 81 years,
						showed increased lean body and bone mass, decreased fat mass and,
						perhaps most dramatically, restoration of skin thickness to that
						typical of a 50-year-old.<br />
				  <br />
						The study cited above and a handful of others have provided an
						initial understanding of the benefits, limitations and risks of
						sustained (6 to 12 month)  supplementation in elderly males and females. A consistent finding in these investigations was a high
						incidence of adverse side effects - edema, fluid retention and
						carpal tunnel syndrome - which necessitated reductions in dosage or cessation of treatment. HGH consistently induced an
						increase in serum IGF-1, a decrease in fat mass and increase in
						lean mass.<br />
				  <br />
						The effects on fat and lean masses may be viewed as positive
						effects, but, at the end of the day, it has to be asked whether
						the therapy improved functioning in the elderly. In the studies
						in which function was objectively assessed,  the therapy did not
						improve cognitive function, and, despite the effects on lean body
						mass, was not any more effective than exercise alone in promoting
						strength. Long-term HGH therapy in elderly postmenopausal females
						lead to significant increases in bone mineral density, but these
						increases were less than what is routinely achieved with estrogen
						replacement. While it must be acknowledged that a relatively
						small number of elderly patients have been treated for prolonged
						periods, the controlled trials conducted thus far do not
						support is efficacy in alleviating age-related deficits in
						cognitive or somatic function.<br />
				  <br />
						Another indication of potentially serious side effects of HGH
						therapy in adults, including the elderly, has been provided by
						controlled clinical trials that assessed the utility of human growth hormone
						treatment in critical illness, where endogenous  secretion is
						typically suppressed. Therapy was anticipated to attenuate the
						catabolic effects of illness and thereby decrease duration of
						hospitalization. The results of several clinical trials involving
						hundreds of patients, demonstrated a significant increase in
						mortality associated with high doses. Additionally, those
						patients treated that survived had longer periods of
						intensive care and hospitalization than those receiving
						placebos.<br />
