					<h1><span class="header1">HGH Human Growth Hormone Clinical Studies</span> </h1>
					</div>
				<div>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">      Now to the straight poop on all
					  the HGH &quot;clinical studies&quot; that you might read about. There have
					  not been thousands of HGH clinical studies as I've seen some claim. In
					  fact, when it comes to the use of HGH in relation to Anti-Aging,
					  there have only been a handful! The product is too new. When
					  doing research on Human Growth Hormone you first have to figure
					  out if the clinical study you are reading relates to pills, HGH shots, or
					  HGH sprays. Most of the clinical studies have to do with HGH
					  injected. The &quot;clinical studies&quot; relating to pills and sprays
					  have almost all been done by the manufacturers themselves.
				  &quot;Caveat Emptor,&quot; Buyer Beware. Since oral sprays have not been on
					  the market for that long there simply hasn't been time for any
					  true, scientifically instituted, clinical studies. The FDA has
					  approved the substance for retail sale. The only information
					  that's currently available on spray therapy is considered
				  &quot;anecdotal.&quot; However, it's not surprising that most of these
					  reports &quot;mirror&quot; the results of injected human growth hormone
					  clinical studies. Ultimately, the consumer has to try the product on his
					  own to decide if the results are worth the price of the therapy.
					  Click here to view our <a href="metabolic.htm">HGH human growth hormone clinical studies</a>.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">There are basically only two or
					  three  clinical studies on injectible, pharmaceutical, human
					  growth hormone in relation to it's anti-aging capacities. And the
					  FDA has never approved the hormone for anti-aging. The most
					  widely referred HGH clinical study was done by Dr. Daniel Rudman. He
					  published his findings on the effects of Anti-Aging and HGH in
					  the New England Journal of Medicine. The results were quite
					  amazing! Working with volunteers aged 61 to 81 at the Medical
					  College of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Dr. Rudman used HGH manufactured
					  synthetically, and injected, to replicate what is created
					  naturally in the body's own pituitary gland. The initial observed
					  results: Six months of injections reversed the aging process from
					  10 to 20 years in the patients who received the injections. In the control
					  group that didn't receive the injections, the normal aging process
					  continued. This early human growth hormone clinical study involved only a couple hundred
					  people, all older men, but the results were
					  overwhelming.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Another clinical study of the effects of
					  human growth hormone on humans was done at the Palm Springs Life
					  Extension Institute under the direction of Dr. Edmund Chein,
					  director of the institute, and his associate Dr. Leon Terry, a
					  neuroendocrinologist from the Department of Neurology at the
					  Medical College of Wisconsin. Dr. Chein, by combining HGH
					  injections with other hormones that are shown to be low, has
					  developed a program that he claims has been 100% effective for
					  all of his patients. He guarantees that his patients will
					  experience an increase in bone density of 1.5 - 2.5% every six
					  months, as well as a loss of 10% body fat and an increase of 10%
					  muscle mass. We do not have any opinion on the veracity of these
					  claims.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Dr. Terry collected the data of
					  patients who have been treated at the Life Extension Institute
					  and has written up the following assessment figures which were
					  derived from randomly selected, self-assessment questionnaires
					  completed by 202 patients during the term of their therapy
					  between the years of 1994 and 1996.</p>

					<h2><p align="left" class="toplinks">Dr. Ronald Klatz</p></h2>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Another often quoted researcher
					  is Dr. Ronald Klatz, M.D., President of the American Academy of
					  Anti-Aging Medicine. At the present time he does not endorse any
					  form of therapy. However, according to Dr. Klatz, &quot;Aging
					  appears to be due in large part to the drastic decline of growth
					  hormone in the body after adulthood.&quot; His research has concluded
					  that one of the primary causes of aging is the decrease of
					  hormonal production. At age 21, the normal level circulating
					  is about 10 milligrams per deciliter of blood, while at age
					  61 it is 2 milligrams (an 80% decrease!). It is human growth
					  hormone that grows the cells, bones, muscles, and organs, and it
					  is the decreased level of this substance after age 30 that slowly
					  robs us of our youth. After the age of 30, the secretion rate drops by 14% per decade. By age 80, most people barely
					  produce enough  to rebuild much of anything, which explains
					  why injuries experienced by seniors take so long to
					  heal.</p>
					<p align="left" class="style12"> <span class="style13"><img src=
				"images/chart.gif" align="right" width="373" height="218" vspace=
				"0" hspace="10" alt="HGH" border="3" />The following
					  table, from the National Institute of Health Research, April
					  1995, shows how HGH declines with age so that &quot;elderly&quot; levels
					  are reached by the early ages of 35-40.</span></p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Finally, another often quoted
					  researcher is Dr. Eve Van Cauter, University of Chicago
					  Medical Center, who says, &quot;All of these ideas about treating
					  people with human growth hormone have been directed towards people 65
					  and older. If you look at the data, people have so-called
					  &quot;elderly&quot; levels by age 40. Perhaps we should be giving replacement therapy earlier rather than attempting to treat
					  tissues that have seen little or no growth hormone for
					  decades.&quot;</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">The above are, basically, all
					  the relevant clinical reports we have on human growth hormone. Pretty
					  slim pickins, huh?, but not unusual considering the newness of
					  the product. The bottom line here is that all the &quot;claims&quot;
					  retailers tell you  are mostly testimonials given by
					  users. The only &quot;clinical studies&quot; of oral sprays are those that
					  have been done by manufacturers and there are no clinical studies
					  surrounding secretagogues and stacked amino nutritional products
					  that we've seen. And, by the way, it should not be overlooked
					  that the testimonials are all positive. Just recognize them for
					  what they are. The product is so new, testimonials are all we
					  have!</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">The bottom line is: will the
					  therapy work for you? We don't know. We're all different. You'll
					  have to try it and find out (another great sales pitch, eh?). In
					  the homeopathic oral spray form it's very, very gentle. So
					  gentle, in fact, that the general recommendation from
					  manufacturers and distributors is that you use the product for
					  two to three months to see if it affects you positively. We
					  believe most people will see results much quicker but we think
					  they recommend that time period because if you are in terrible
					  shape to begin with, it's going to take longer for the therapy to
					  straighten things out. It is not a powerful drug. However, if
					  you are in excellent health you will probably recognize subtle
					  changes within a couple of days. So depending on where you are in
					  that health range you'll have to give the product time to act.
					  Try it, you'll like it! 21st Century HGH gives a full, 90-day, money back
					  guarantee.</p>
