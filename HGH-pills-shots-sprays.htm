				<div>
					 <h2><p align="center" class="style11">Pills, Shots, Sprays Analyzed</p></h2>
						<p align="left" class="bodytext"><br />
						  HGH
						  Human Growth Hormone was first discovered in 1956 and its
						  structure was identified in 1972. It was extracted from cadavers,
						  sold at very high prices, and injected via intra muscular shots. In mid-1998 the 191 chain HGH molecule was genetically
						  engineered in the laboratory. This is available to us now through
						  a costly doctor's pharmaceutical prescription, and secondly at a
						  reasonable price through homeopathic oral sprays. The third
						  therapy alternative would be Secretogogues and Stacked Amino
						  pills. The idea here is to coax your own body, by stimulating
						  the Pituitary Gland, to produce more of it's own HGH. So the
						  consumer has these three choices: HGH sprays, shots, or pills.
						  With all three choices the goal is the same: to raise the
						  measurable IGF-1 level. To discover which protocol is right for
						  you we offer a short discussion below on all three
						  therapies.</p>
						<p align="left" class="bodytext">It should be noted that the
						  Federal Drug Administration does not allow <u>any</u> nutritional product to claim that it can
					  &quot;cure&quot; <u>any</u> disease. The FDA <u>does
						approve</u> Pharmaceutical drugs and
						  Homeopathic preparations to claim they can cure a particular
						  disease and the testing to achieve this status is quite rigorous
						  as we all know. A doctor is permitted to prescribe Human Growth
						  Hormone to a patient for anti-aging even though it's only
						  approved by the FDA as a cure for dwarfism. The Pharmaceutical
						  manufacturer is not permitted to suggest it's use as an
						  anti-aging therapy, only as a treatment for dwarfism, and one
						  company ended up paying substantial fines and penalties for doing
						  just that. The large majority of Homeopathic remedies do, with
						  FDA approval, claim to cure various ailments. Homeopathic HGH is
						  one of only a handful of preparations that claims to &quot;cure&quot;
						  nothing. 21st Century HGH  is manufactured at an FDA monitored and
						  approved laboratory. The curious difference between
						  pharmaceutical  shots and homeopathic sprays is that even though the former
							injects huge amounts of the actual hormone, compared to only a
							miniscule amount in the homeopathic preparation, the rejuvenation levels are remarkably
							similar!</p>
						  <h3 align="left" class="toplinks">Human Growth Hormone Pills</h3>
						  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Being very conservative the
						  idea of stimulating my own body's production of HGH through
						  nutritional supplement pills sounded the most &quot;natural&quot; to me.
						  However, the authoritative Physician's Desk Reference Manual
						  rates different forms of absorption by the body and yields
						  eye-opening information regarding pills. It says that when a pill is swallowed,
						  less than 10% of the nutrient actually gets into the blood
						  stream. The other 90% of the pill is processed by the gastrointestinal tract
						  as waste. Oral absorption through the mucosa (the lining of the
						  mouth) is the preferred choice of medical experts because the
						  body absorbs 90% of the nutrient into the bloodstream. That's a
						  huge difference compared to pills. What was not a big difference to us, but was
						  still very interesting, was that oral absorption (90%) was higher
						  than intra-muscular shots (80%).</p>
						<p align="left" class="bodytext">So, piling a bunch of
						  tablets into my body in the form of stacked amino acids and
						  secretagogues, most of which would actually pass through me, just
						  to coax my Pituitary Gland into a little bit of action didn't
						  seem like a plan to me. Also, after a few months taking pills the Pituitary
						  gland says, &quot;no mas,&quot; and refuses to get stimulated into action
						  no matter what the supplemental dosage. Additionally, I was
						  scared away by reports that taking stacked amino &quot;growth hormone
						  pills&quot; can raise cortisol levels in the body, which is extremely
						  unhealthy. So, rejecting these tablets, the choice then came down to actually putting the
						  hormone into my body by way of injections or via oral
						  sprays.</p>
						  <h3 align="left" class="toplinks">Human Growth Hormone
							Shots</h3>
						  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Almost all the HGH sites will
						  say that the cost for shots ranges between $10,000 and
						  $20,000 per year. It doesn't. It is easily found
						  for around $3,000 per year and even lower  through
						  Mexican pharmaceuticals. Needles today are very safe and
						  generally painless. But sticking myself twice a day with shots, twenty days
						  per month, didn't seem like a routine a healthy person should be
						  doing, no matter how quick and easy it is. Call me squeamish. I don't care. Taking shots might suit some people, and if it
						  does,  go for it. Not me. Those taking Hgh
						  shots should be aware that a few problems have been reported
						  with &quot;high&quot; or &quot;over&quot; dosages, so anyone using a shot protocol
						  would be wise to be clinically monitored on a regular basis by a
						  physician.</p>
						  <h3 align="left" class="toplinks">Human Growth Hormone Sprays</h3>
						  <p align="left" class="bodytext">So the spray option was the
						  one I chose, especially considering the fact that I didn't know
						  if it would deliver what retailers were claiming. It
						  seemed to be the most benign, risk free, gentle therapy that
						  produced excellent results, and was reasonably priced between
						  $500 and $1250 per year. The amounts of herbal and nutritional
						  contents listed on a product label can be most misleading. What's
						  important is not the nutritional content listed on the label, but
						  rather how much of that nutrient is actually absorbed into the
						  cells of the body. Sprays provide excellent absorption when
						  micro-sized beads or droplets of a nutrient are taken into the
						  body through the tissue lining of the mouth or nose. Blood
						  capillaries are extremely close to the surface in these areas and
						  readily absorb the Hgh spray into the bloodstream. The flow of absorbed
						  nutrients from this area of the mouth is to the Carotid Artery,
						  then to the brain, and then on to the heart within 22 to 30
						  seconds. Within minutes sprays are totally dispersed throughout the
						  body.</p>
						<p align="left" class="bodytext">As far as which product is the
						  best, it's my belief that if and when independent clinical trials
						  are made of all the orally delivered products will basically be
						  close in effectiveness. They all contain the same amounts of
						  Somotrophin. Some add a little bit of this, some add a little bit
						  of that. I chose the spray I thought was most homeopathically
						  prepared because I knew more care would have been taken in its
						  manufacturing and it would probably be more gentle on my system.
						  But honestly, when shopping around for sprays that may or may not work, how do you
						  know which one to buy? Ultimately, it probably doesn't really
						  matter that much! But I do hope you buy mine. Now how's that for
						  a sales pitch?</p>
						<p align="left" class="bodytext">Speaking of sales pitches, the
						  market is beset by some overzealous
						  marketers who sometimes make claims that are somewhat
						  misleading, especially in the area of <a href=
					"hgh-clinicalstudies.htm">hgh human growth hormone clinical studies</a>. I've read through many entire websites which
						  make claims, based on pharmaceutical <strong>HGH </strong>shots, that imply the same
						  results will occur with their nutritional product. They are just
						  &quot;fast talking&quot; their clientele. Learn as much as possible and make a decision based on personal preferences. No matter what age you begin taking the product,
						  the results are amazing.</p>
