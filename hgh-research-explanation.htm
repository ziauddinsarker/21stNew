					<h1><span class="header1">Growth Hormone Facts</span> </h1>
					</div>
				<div>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"><br />
					<span class="bodytext">Growth hormone, also known as somatotropin, is a
				  protein of about 190 amino acids that is synthesized and
				  secreted by cells called somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary. It
				  is a major participant in control of several complex physiologic
				  processes, including growth and metabolism. It is also of
				  considerable interest as a drug used in both humans and animals.<br />
					  <br />
					  <b>Physiologic Effects</b><br />
					  <img src="images/somatotropin1.gif" align="right" width="200" height="225" vspace="0" hspace="10" alt="0" border="0" />A
				  critical concept in understanding human growth hormone, hgh,
				  activity is that it has two distinct types of effects:</span></p>
				<ul class="style68"><li><p align="left" class="bodytext"> Direct effects are the result of human growth hormone (HGH)
					  binding its receptor on target cells. Fat cells (adipocytes), for
					  example, have human growth hormone receptors, and HGH stimulates
					  them to break down triglyceride and supresses their ability to take
					  up and accumulate circulating lipids.</p>
				</li>
				  <li>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Indirect effects are mediated primarily by a
					  insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),  secreted from
					  the liver and other tissues in response to HGH. A majority
					  of the cell promoting effects is actually due to
					  IGF-1 acting on its target cells. <br />
					</p>
				  </li>
				  </ul>
				<p align="left" class="bodytext"> Keeping this distinction in mind, we can discuss two
				  major roles of HGH and its minion IGF-1 in physiology.<br />
					  <br />
					  <b>Effects on Height&nbsp;</b><br />
				  This is a very complex process, and requires the
				  coordinated action of several hormones. The major role in gaining height is to stimulate the liver and
				  other tissues to secrete IGF-1. IGF-1 stimulates proliferation of
				  chondrocytes (cartilage cells), resulting in bone development. Human Growth
				  hormone does seem to have a direct effect on bone development in
				  stimulating differentiation of chondrocytes.<br />
					  <br />
				  IGF-1 also appears to be the key player in muscle
				  development. It stimulates both the differentiation and proliferation of
				  myoblasts. It also stimulates amino acid uptake and protein synthesis
				  in muscle and other tissues.<br />
					  <br />
					  <b>Metabolic Effects&nbsp;</b><br />
				  HGH has important effects on protein, lipid
				  and carbohydrate metabolism. In some cases, a direct effect has been clearly demonstrated, in others, IGF-1 is thought to
				  be the critical mediator, and some cases it appears that both direct
				  and indirect effects are at play.<br />
					  <br />
				  Protein metabolism: In general, human growth hormone
				  stimulates protein anabolism in many tissues. This effect reflects
				  increased amino acid uptake, increased protein synthesis and
				  decreased oxidation of proteins.<br />
					  <br />
				  Fat metabolism: HGH enhances the
				  utilization of fat by stimulating triglyceride breakdown and
				  oxidation in adipocytes.<br />
					  <br />
				  Carbohydrate metabolism: HGH is one of many that serves to maintain blood glucose within a
				  normal range. It is often said to have anti-insulin
				  activity, because it supresses the abilities of insulin to stimulate
				  uptake of glucose in peripheral tissues and enhance glucose synthesis
				  in the liver. Somewhat paradoxically, administrationstimulates insulin secretion, leading to hyperinsulinemia.<br />
					  <br />
					  <b>Control of Secretion</b><br />
					  <img src="images/somatotropin2.gif" align="right" width="250" height="240" vspace="0" hspace="10" alt="0" border="0" />Production
				  of HGH is modulated by many factors, including stress,
				  exercise, nutrition, sleep and HGH itself. However, its
				  primary controllers are two hypothalamic hormones and one from the stomach:</p>
				<ul class="style68"><li><p align="left" class="bodytext"> Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is a
					  hypothalamic peptide that stimulates both synthesis and secretion.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"> Somatostatin (SS) is a peptide produced by several
					  tissues in the body, including the hypothalamus. Somatostatin
					  inhibits HGH release in response to GHRH and to other
					  stimulatory factors such as low blood glucose concentration.</p>
				  </li>
				  <li>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"> Ghrelin is a peptide secreted from the
					  stomach. Ghrelin binds to receptors on somatotrophs and potently
					  stimulates secretion.</p>
				  </li>
				</ul>
				<p align="left" class="bodytext"> Human Growth hormone secretion is also part of a negative
				  feedback loop involving IGF-1. High blood levels of IGF-1 lead to
				  decreased secretion not only by directly
				  suppressing the somatotroph, but by stimulating release of
				  somatostatin from the hypothalamus.<br />
					  <br />
				  HGH also feeds back to inhibit GHRH
				  secretion and probably has a direct (autocrine) inhibitory effect on
				  secretion from the somatotroph.<br />
					  <br />
				  Integration of all the factors that affect synthesis and secretion lead to a pulsatile pattern of
				  release. Basal concentrations  in blood are very
				  low. In children and young adults, the most intense period of HGH release is shortly after the onset of deep sleep.</p>
				<p align="left" class="bodytext"><b>Disease States</b><br />
				  States of both  deficiency
				  and excess provide very visible testaments to the role of it in normal physiology. Such disorders can reflect lesions in
				  either the hypothalamus, the pituitary or in target cells. A
				  deficiency state can result not only from a deficiency in production, but in the target cell's response.<br />
					  <br />
				  Clinically, deficiency  or receptor
				  defects show up as retardation or dwarfism. The manifestation of
				  HGH deficiency depends upon the age of onset of the
				  disorder and can result from either heritable or acquired disease.<br />
					  <br />
				  The effect of excessive secretion of  is
				  also very dependent on the age of onset and is seen as two
				  distinctive disorders:<br />
					  <br />
				  Giantism is the result of excessive secretion that begins in young children or adolescents. It is a very
				  rare disorder, usually resulting from a tumor of somatotropes. One of
				  the most famous giants was a man named Robert Wadlow. He weighed 8.5
				  pounds at birth, but by 5 years of age was 105 pounds and 5 feet 4
				  inches tall. Robert reached an adult weight of 490 pounds and 8 feet
				  11 inches in height. He died at age 22.<br />
					  <br />
					  Acromegaly results from excessive secretion in adults. The onset of this disorder is typically insideous.
				  Clinically, an overdevelopment of bone and connective leads to a change in
				  appearance that might be described as having &quot;coarse
				  features&quot;. The excessive human growth hormone and IGF-1 also lead to
				  metabolic derangements, including glucose intolerance.</p>
				<p align="left" class="bodytext"> <span class="bodytext"><strong>Pharmaceutical and Biotechnological Uses</strong><br />
				  In years past, HGH purified from human
				  cadaver pituitaries was used to treat children with severe height
				  retardation. More recently, the virtually unlimited supply of
				  recombinant HGH has lead to several other applications to
				  human and animal populations.<br />
				  <br />
				  It is commonly used to treat
				  children of pathologically short stature. There is concern that this
				  practice will be extended to treatment of essentially normal children
				  - so called &quot;enhancement therapy&quot;  on
				  demand. Similarly, HGH has been used by some to enhance
				  atheletic performance. Although HGH therapy is generally
				  safe, it is not as safe as no therapy and does entail unpredictable
				  health risks. Parents that request HGH therapy for <br />
					  <br />
				  The role of human growth hormone in normal aging remains
				  poorly understood, but some of the cosmetic symptoms of aging appear
				  to be amenable to this therapy. This is an active area of
				  research, and additional information and recommendations about risks
				  and benefits will undoubtedly surface in the near future.<br />
					 <br />
				  Human growth hormone facts therapy is currently approved and marketed for
				  enhancing milk production in dairy cattle. There is no doubt that
				  administration of bovine somatotropin to lactating cows results in
				  increased milk yield, and, depending on the way the cows are managed,
				  can be an economically-viable therapy. However, this treatment
				  engenders abundant controversy, even among dairy farmers. One thing
				  that appears clear is that drinking milk from cattle treated with
				  bovine growth hormone facts does not pose a risk to human health.</span></p>
