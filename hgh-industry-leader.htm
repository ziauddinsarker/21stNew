					<h1><span class="header1">Industry Leader Tells The HGH Truth</span> </h1>
					</div>
				<div>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"><em><strong>Any  consumer who first hears about the marvelous benefits of HGH, Human Growth  Hormone, has no idea about the journey he is about to embark upon.&nbsp;</strong></em> Our company has the largest and most  informative industry website about human growth hormone on the internet.&nbsp;  We&rsquo;ve seen it all.&nbsp; Mostly we  deal with confused consumers all the time so hopefully this article will help  consumers make informed decisions.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">In  a nutshell, comprehensive research will reveal that there are 3 ways to get human growth hormone into your system: shots, pills, sprays.&nbsp;  Pharmaceutical HGH injection therapy requires a doctor&rsquo;s prescription,  the continuous use of needles, is very expensive, but is the most effective.&nbsp; Pills, all of which contain absolutely no  HGH, are the least expensive and fail to work at all after 6 weeks of continued  use.&nbsp; Homeopathic HGH oral sprays,  containing real pharmaceutical HGH, are reasonably priced, very safe, approved  by the FDA for over the counter sales, work continuously for years, and yield  60%-80% of the same results of human growth hormone injection therapies.&nbsp; </p>
					<h2><h3 align="left" class="toplinks"><strong>HGH Truth: Shady industry  vendors take advantage of quick profits</strong></h3></h2>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">We  will be the first to admit that the industry is very shady.&nbsp; The  biggest problem comes from the &quot;HGH Releaser&quot; vendors who sell a few  pennies worth of amino acids at a price close to those selling real HGH.&nbsp;  Since their profit margins are so much greater they have the financial capacity  to market their products in ways vendors of oral sprays can't afford.&nbsp;  They do radio, TV, print media, and end up in high positions on Internet search  engines.&nbsp; They can afford it.&nbsp; Their profit is great and their  marketing pitch is very shrill.&nbsp; Their product works for a month then,  bam, all the benefits disappear.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a  terrible tease and we get their dissatisfied customers all the time.&nbsp; </p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">Again,  we will be the first to admit that pharmaceutical HGH, purchased through a  doctor with a prescription, and injected into the body, is the superior way to  get human growth hormone into your system.&nbsp; But the results you get from homeopathic oral sprays, at a reasonable cost, without sticking yourself with needles,  seems to be a far more reasonable way to go.&nbsp; We are  not at odds with doctors pushing pharmaceutical injections.&nbsp; We think  the consumer should make an educated choice.</p>
					<h3 align="left" class="toplinks"><strong>HGH Truth: Alarmist  nature of Quackwatch and Industry Drug Companies</strong></h3>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">To  begin, the consumer should recognize the first truth of industry media: &quot;Sex  Sells!&quot;&nbsp; Look at all the major media outlets from TV to Music to  Movies to News, &quot;sex sells.&quot;&nbsp; The more outrageous and the more  alarmist (&quot;sexy&quot;) news can be, the more it attracts an  audience.&nbsp; So when a &quot;credentialed&quot; doctor writes an article for  a publication that purportedly is &quot;protecting&quot; the consumer from industry scams, the more  they can scare you, the better.&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">This  is true of the popular Quackwatch article currently circulating throughout the  Internet that pooh-poohs homeopathic HGH oral sprays.&nbsp; In our opinion, they would be more believable if they weren't  pushing their own pharmaceutical drugs.&nbsp; If they were really &quot;protecting  the consumer&quot; from quacks and fakes in the industry, they would bring to bear their own  scientific evidence why &quot;HGH releasers&quot; fail after a month, or why  homeopathic remedies are not considered mainstream.&nbsp; But they don't do  this.&nbsp; They make no objective arguments preferring, instead, to make  simple pronouncements and to use scare tactics.&nbsp; They scare you with old  information about the worst shysters in the industry.&nbsp; They hide the truth  about the problems of their own pharmaceutical drugs and mislead you about the  &ldquo;illegality&rdquo; of homeopathic remedies.&nbsp; Sex sells!&nbsp; Buyer beware.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">The  quackwatch article brought up factual information about 3 companies in the industry that were  convicted a long time ago.&nbsp; Sited were the worst offenders in the industry, 3 of over 300, less than 1% of all vendors.&nbsp; We'd like to ask  Dr. Barrett, author of the quackwatch article, &ldquo;How many doctors are sued for  malpractice every year?&nbsp; 1%?&nbsp; More?&rdquo;</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">The  author brought forth information that was adjudicated many years ago.&nbsp;  Since that time the Federal Trade Commission has cleaned up a lot of the  industry.&nbsp; In 2005 all vendors of HGH products were sent letters from the  FTC informing them of what &quot;claims&quot; can and cannot be made.&nbsp;  Most vendors complied.&nbsp; Some have not.&nbsp; We can advise you that many  of those vendors who have complied the least come up very high in Yahoo and MSN  searches.&nbsp; Not so in Google searches.&nbsp; Don't ask us why because we  don't know the vagaries of search engine rankings in the industry.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">The  FDA monitors the labels of most homeopathic oral sprays and shuts down  those companies that label their products using the descriptive term  &quot;nanograms.&quot;&nbsp; This is illegal.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">The  quackwatch author also conveniently omitted information about the lawsuit  brought against the pharmaceutical company Genentech, a company manufacturing  specifically for doctors prescribing it for injection.&nbsp; Genentech ended their lawsuit with a multi-million dollar payout!</p>
					<p align="left" class="toplinks"><strong>HGH Truth: Homeopathics  vs. Allopathics</strong></p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">Allopathic  medicine is what doctors practice.&nbsp; Homeopathic remedies are what  naturopaths prescribe.&nbsp; The former involves the universe of drugs and the  latter involves the universe of natural products.&nbsp; Although both are  relatively large industries, nutritional products are dwarfed by the sheer size  of the pharmaceutical industry.&nbsp; It is big, big business.&nbsp; The pharmaceutical  industry depends on allopathic physicians to push their drugs.&nbsp; There is  no doubt about the potency of these pharmaceutical products (just read the  warning labels!).&nbsp; But are they <u>all</u> necessary and are they the <u>only</u> answer?</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">Most  (including well known radio doctor Dean Adelle), though not all, allopathic  physicians will tell you that all homeopathic products are useless.&nbsp; They  simply roll up over 150 years of all natural remedies that have helped millions  of people through time and say it's &ldquo;bunk.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the case of HGH, IGF-1  levels (the result of an increase in HGH) can be measured.&nbsp; These levels  rise in many people who use homeopathic oral sprays.&nbsp; How more  objective can you get?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					<h3 align="left" class="toplinks"><strong>HGH Truth: IGF-1 Testing</strong></h3>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">Now  here's the rub: there is no motivation for any <em>independent  agency</em> to do expensive, comparative, IGF-1 testing on all the  various products on the market today.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the consumer has no  basis for an independent, objective, comparing of products.&nbsp; Basically,  you just have to rely on the &quot;claims&quot; of the vendors.&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">Blood  tests to measure IGF-1 levels cost $500-$800.&nbsp; At the minimum you need one  test before you begin your therapy and one test monthly after that.&nbsp; Pharmaceutical companies have had to do this  testing to gain FDA approval.&nbsp; We did our own private testing of IGF-1  levels on people using our product to make sure it worked prior to selling it  to the general public.&nbsp; But honestly, if we tested 5 people or 50 people  or 5,000 people, would it be wise for you to really believe the results of a  test we did on our own product?&nbsp; If I were a consumer I certainly would  not.&nbsp; The claims other companies make about the effectiveness of their  product we take with a huge grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">We  would gladly put our product up for independent evaluation testing against all  other products on the market today.&nbsp; But who would do it and why?&nbsp;  Again, there's the rub.&nbsp; We know what the results would show:  pharmaceutical human growth hormone gets the best results, HGH releasers decline markedly after  one month, and homeopathic oral sprays show 60%-80% of the results of doctor prescribed injections.&nbsp; We'd love for an independent agency to do the tests and prove  us right or wrong!&nbsp; But we know this  probably will never happen.&nbsp; Too bad for  the consumer!</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">Again,  we come back to the same conclusion: neither an allopathic nor naturopathic  specialist can tell you in advance if this hormone therapy will work for you or not.&nbsp;  You&rsquo;ll just have to try it on your own.&nbsp;  Most, though not all, vendors provide a 100% guarantee.&nbsp; So if your choice of therapy does nothing  for you, exercise your right to a refund (find one who offers an easy, no  questions asked guarantee).&nbsp; However, if your choice does  work for you it's the best investment you've ever made in your entire  life.&nbsp; </p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style10">Good Luck!</p>
