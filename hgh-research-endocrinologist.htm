					  What is an Endocrinologist?</b>&nbsp;<br />
						They are a specially trained doctor.
						  They diagnose diseases that affect your glands. They know
						  how to treat these conditions, which are often complex and involve
						  many systems and structures within your body. Your regular doctor
						  refers you to an endocrinologist when you have a problem with your
						  endocrine system.<br />
						  <br />
						  <b>What is the endocrine system?</b>&nbsp;<br />
						  Its a system of glands. Glands
							are organs that make hormones. These are substances that help to
							control activities in your body. They control reproduction,
							metabolism (food burning and waste elimination), and growth and
							development. They also control the way you respond to your
							surroundings. They help to provide the proper amount of energy and
							nutrition. The endocrine glands include the thyroid, parathyroid,
							pancreas, ovaries, testes, adrenal, pituitary and hypothalamus. HGH is produced in the pituitary.<br />
						  <br />
							<b>What do endocrinologists do?</b>&nbsp;<br />
							They are trained to recognize and uncover
							HGH imbalances. They help to restore the natural balance of
							hormones, HGH, in your system. They also conduct basic research
							to learn the secrets of glands. Clinical research helps them learn
							the best ways to treat patients especially those with HGH human growth hormone deficiencies. They develop new drugs
							and treatments for human growth hormone disorders. They take care of many functions
							and challenges regarding HGH:<br />
						  <br />
						  diabetes&nbsp;<br />
						  thyroid diseases&nbsp;<br />
						  metabolism&nbsp;<br />
						  hormonal imbalances&nbsp;<br />
						  menopause&nbsp;<br />
						  osteoporosis&nbsp;<br />
						  hypertension&nbsp;<br />
						  cholesterol (lipid) disorders&nbsp;<br />
						  infertility and birth control&nbsp;<br />
						  shortness (short stature)&nbsp;<br />
							cancers of the gland<br />
						  HGH<br />
						  <br />
						  <strong>What type of medical training do Endocrinologists receive?</strong><br />
						  They finish four years of medical school.
					They spend three or four years in an internship and residency
					program. These specialty programs cover internal medicine, HGH Human Growth Hormone studies,
					pediatrics, or obstetrics and gynecology. They spend two or three
					more years learning how to diagnose and treat human growth hormone, HGH, conditions.<br />
						  <br />
						  <b>What are the most common endocrine diseases and imbalances?</b><br />
						  The diseases and imbalances are grouped into
							 several areas. Some doctors focus on one or two areas, such
							 as diabetes, pediatric problems, thyroid, or reproductive and
							 menstrual disorders. Others work in all areas including HGH. The
							 major areas of  are described below:<br />
						   <br />
							<b>Diabetes&nbsp;</b><br />
							Patients with diabetes have too much sugar in their
							 blood. Recent studies have found that excellent blood sugar control
							 helps prevent problems from diabetes. Problems in the eyes, kidneys
							 and nerves can be very serious. They can lead to blindness, dialysis,
							 or amputation. Endocrinologists treat diabetes with diet and
							 medications, including insulin. They also work closely with patients
							 to control blood sugar and monitor them so they can prevent health problems.<br />
						   <br />
							<b>Thyroid</b>&nbsp;<br />
							Patients with thyroid disorders often have problems
							 with their energy levels. They may also have trouble with muscle
							 strength, emotions, weight control, and tolerating heat or cold.
							 They treat patients with too much or too little
							 thyroid. They help patients reach a hormone balance by
							 replacing thyroid hormone. Endocrinologists also receive special
							 training to manage patients with thyroid growths or cancer, and
							 swollen thyroid glands.</p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext style68"><b>Bone</b>&nbsp;<br />
						Osteomalacia (rickets, which causes bones to soften)
						  and osteoporosis are bone diseases that endocrinologists diagnose and
						  treat. Osteoporosis is a disease that weakens your skeleton. Certain
						  hormones act to protect bone tissue. When these  levels drop,
						  bones can lose tissue and weaken. Menopause, loss of testicle
						  function, and aging may put you at risk for bone breaks.
						  Other problems are treated that can affect bones such as
						  too much parathyroid.<br />
						  <br />
						  <b>Reproduction/Infertility</b>&nbsp;<br />
						  About one in ten American couples are infertile.
							Endocrine research has helped thousands of couples to have children.
							Endocrinologists diagnose and treat the precise imbalance
							that causes infertility. They also assess and treat
							patients with reproductive problems based in glands. They work with
							patients who need hormone replacement. Problems that they treat
							include menopause symptoms, irregular periods, endometriosis,
							polycystic ovary syndrome, premenstrual syndrome, and impotence.<br />
						  <br />
							<b>Obesity and Overweight&nbsp;</b><br />
							Endocrinologists treat patients who are overweight or
							obese, often because of metabolic and hormonal problems. The sign of
							obesity is too much body fat. Thyroid, adrenal, ovarian, and
							pituitary disorders can cause obesity. Endocrinologists also identify
							factors linked with obesity. These factors include insulin resistance
							and genetic problems and can be treated with HGH.<br />
						  <br />
							<b>Pituitary Gland</b>&nbsp;<br />
							The pituitary is often called the master gland of the
							body because it controls other glands. The pituitary makes several
							vital hormones including HGH. Over- or under- production of pituitary gland can
							lead to infertility, menstrual disorders, growth disorders
							(acromegaly or short stature) and too much cortisol (Cushing's
							syndrome). Endocrinologists control these conditions with medications
							and refer patients who need surgery.<br />
						  <br />
							<b>Growth</b>&nbsp;<br />
							Pediatric endocrinologists treat children with
							endocrine problems that cause short stature and other human growth
							hormone problems. Thanks to endocrine research, safe and effective treatments
							are available for people whose HGH is abnormal.<br />
						  <br />
							<b>Hypertension</b><br />
							Hypertension is high blood pressure, and it is a risk
							factor for heart disease. Up to 10% of people have hypertension
							because of too much aldosterone, a hormone produced in the adrenal
							glands. About half of these cases are caused by growths that can be
							removed with surgery. Conditions such as the metabolic syndrome or a
							growth called a pheochromocytoma also may cause hypertension. These
							conditions also can be treated successfully along with HGH therapy.<br />
						  <br />
							<b>Lipid Disorders</b>&nbsp;<br />
							Patients with lipid disorders have trouble maintaining
							normal levels of body fats. One of the most common lipid disorders is
							hyperlipidemia - high levels of total cholesterol, low-density
							lipoprotein cholesterol (known as &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol),
							and/or triglycerides in the blood. High levels of these fats are
							linked to heart and blood vessel (coronary heart) disease, strokes,
							and other diseases. Hypertension is common in people with lipid
							disorders, and together these factors put patients at higher risk for
							coronary heart disease. These doctors are trained to detect
							factors that may be related to lipid disorders, such as
							hypothyroidism, drug use (such as steroid use), or genetic or
							metabolic conditions. Lipid disorders can be found in several
							conditions that require special management, including the metabolic
							syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, and obesity. Special diets,
							HGH, exercise, and medications, including estrogen replacement therapy in
							some cases, may be prescribed to manage hyperlipidemia and other
						lipid disorders.</p>
