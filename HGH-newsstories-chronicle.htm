					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">        Hello,<br />
						<br />
						I have been taking ZLabs  for a year -- I am not sure if it is working or not -- I am very skeptical about ALL of the HGH-related supplements including the injections-- You claim yours is real and works --They claim that you can't buy anything real and that there's is your only hope of stimulating the body to produce its own HGH -- I have a couple of questions, maybe a few...<br />
						  <br />
						1) If I were to go to a doctor, how much would he inject into my system each visit?<br />
						2) How many mg. of HGH is one IU?<br />
						3) How many IU's are contained in your one oz. of fluid that costs over $80?<br />
						4) How many IU's is a good dose and how do you know that?<br />
						  <br />
						5) My most important question -- Where are you getting it from? my understanding is that it can only be harvested from the pituitary glands of dead people.<br />
						6) Is your oral spray legal?<br />
						7) It is my understanding that the reasons why companies don't offer real HGH online is because (1) it is too costly and, more importantly (2) It is legal to dispense without a prescription.<br />
						  <br />
						If you can answer these questions to my satisfaction then I will purchase my first three bottles immediately.<br />
						  <br />
						Thanks!<br />
						Robert<br />
						  <br />
						PS I am 48 and in good shape (I tell people I am 38 and the usually they think I am younger)  - I also take other supplements so it would be difficult for me to notice new results unless they are significant.<br />
						Since I have been taking the ZLabs  my hair has been turning gray at an increasing rate -- I know that is part of aging, but they claim that the product can even make gray hair disappear.  There are so many supplements and so many lies.</p>

					  <p align="left" class="bodytext">Hi - Another comment/question or two:<br />
						  <br />
						1) I see some products advertise 30,000 nanograms of HGH in their one ounce of product. That is .03 mg  and is supposed to last one month. That means that the daily dose is 1/1000 mg or .000001g.....can that dose actually be effective and if so, how do you figure?</p>
					  <p align="left" class="bodytext"><em>Your question is answered in the nature of homeopathic remedies.  To gain a better understanding you might want to do a google search under the term &quot;homeopathy.&quot;  All homeopathic remedies work the same way.  You take a small piece of something, ingest it, and it triggers the body into responding as if it had a huge increase in something.  Our product is formulated with the exact recipe that triggers your liver to produce IGF-1, the stuff that gives you the invigoration properties.  These increases can be measured in blood tests.

Between the doctor's cost of injections and the actual HGH vials and needles it runs about $700-$900 per month. The only over the counter product that contains real HGH is &quot;homeopathic.&quot; The FDA has approved homeopathic  oral sprays for over the counter sales. There are about 30 companies that sell homeopathic  oral sprays. Generally the cost is between $50-$70 per month. With Deer Antler the oral spray runs $80-$120 per month. Every vendor uses the same generic recipe.</em></p>
