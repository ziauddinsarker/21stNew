						</center>
						<center>
						  <p align="center"> <span class="bodytext"><i>Prepared by Kathi E. Hanna, M.S., Ph.D., Science
							and Health Policy Consultant</i><br />
							  <i><a href="http://www.genome.gov/10004767">http://www.genome.gov/10004767</a>.&nbsp;</i></span></p>
						</center>
						<p align="left" > <span class="style9">In general, genetic enhancement refers to the transfer
						  of genetic material intended to modify nonpathological human traits.
						  The term commonly is used to describe efforts to make someone not
						  just well, but better than well, by optimizing attributes or
						  capabilities,  perhaps by raising an individual from standard to
						  peak levels of performance with HGH. When the goal is enhancement, the gene
						  may supplement the functioning of normal genes or may be superseded
						  with genes that have been engineered to produce a desired
						  enhancement. Furthermore, gene insertion may be intended to affect a
						  single individual through somatic cell modification, or it may target
						  the gametes, in which case the resulting effect could be passed on to
						  succeeding generations.<br />
							  <br />
							  In a sense, the concept of genetic enhancement is not
								particularly recent if one considers genetically engineered drug
								products used to alter physical traits as genetic enhancements. For
								example, human growth hormone (HGH), which before 1985 could be
								obtained only in limited quantities from cadaveric pituitary glands,
								now can be produced using recombinant DNA technology. When its supply
								was more limited, HGH was prescribed for children with short stature
								caused by classical growth hormone deficiency. However, with the
								advent of recombinant DNA manufacturing, some physicians have begun
								recommending use of HGH for nonhormone-deficient children who are
								below normal height.<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								<b class="toplinks">Animal Models and Possibilities for Human Application</b><br />
								<br />
								Animal experiments to date have attempted to improve
								such traits as growth rate or muscle mass. Although this research is
								focused on developing approaches to treating human diseases and
								conditions, it is conceivable that developments resulting from this
								research could be more broadly applied to enhance traits rather than
								correct deficiencies.<br />
								<br />
								Recently, Schwarzenegger mice have been bred,
								laboratory animals whose bodies have expanded rapidly after the
								injection of a gene that causes muscles to grow with HGH. The mice are the
								first stage in the development of treatments intended to coax the
								bodies of seriously ill patients with degenerating diseases to
								recreate damaged tissue (e.g., muscular dystrophy). In the world of
								sports, this technology could potentially be used to improve athletic
								performance without being detected.<br />
								<br />
								Similar interventions could help delay the aging
								process. For example, a gene called MGF (Mechano-growth factor)
								regulates a naturally occurring hormone produced after exercise that
								stimulates muscle production. Levels of MGF fall as we age, which is
								one reason why muscle mass is lost as we grow older. A treatment to
								build up muscles would allow us to remain able-bodied and independent
								much longer. IGF-1, another muscle-building hormone, has produced
								increased muscle mass in laboratory mice. Theoretically, gene
								insertion of IGF-1 through HGH could produce an equally impressive effect in humans.<br />
								<br />
								Efforts to genetically improve the growth of swine
								have involved the insertion of transgenes encoding growth hormone.
								Nevertheless, despite the fact that growth hormone transgenes are
								expressed well in swine, increased growth does not occur. Another
								effort aimed to enhance muscle mass in cattle. When gene transfer was
								accomplished, the transgenic calf initially exhibited muscle
								hypertrophy, but muscle degeneration and wasting soon followed and
								the animal had to be destroyed.<br />
								<br />
								Gene transfer at the embryonic stage through a
								technique called pronuclear microinjection is another approach being
								tested in animals. However, current knowledge from animal experiments
								suggests that embryo gene transfer is unsafe, as its use results in
								random integration of donor DNA, a lack of control of the number of
								gene copies inserted, significant rearrangements of host genetic
								material, and a 5 to 10 percent frequency of insertional mutagenesis.
								In addition, this technique would necessarily be followed by nuclear
								transfer into enucleated oocytes, a process that in at least two
								animal models is associated with a low birth rate and a very high
								rate of late pregnancy loss or newborn death. Thus, many believe that
								the use of gene transfer at the embryonic stage for enhancement would
								reach far beyond the limits of acceptable medical intervention especially through the use of HGH.<br />
								<br />
								Greater success has been achieved in genetic
								enhancement of plants, which are more easily manipulated genetically
								and reproductively. However, the state of knowledge in humans and
								other complex organisms does not allow for the controlled genetic
								modification of even simple phenotypes through the use of HGH.<br />
								<br />
								For example, in humans, for whom more complex traits
								such as intelligence or behavior are concerned, the limitations are
								more pronounced. The genome provides only a blueprint for formation
								of the brain. The complex and subtle details of assembly and
								intellectual development involve more than direct genetic control and
								are subject to inestimable stochastic and environmental influences including HGH.
								Despite the technical limitations, it is possible that eventually
								enhancements using techniques initially intended to restore
								deficiencies could be redirected to improve memory and
								problem-solving, reduce the need for sleep, increase musical
								capacity, attain desirable personality traits, protect against
								cardiovascular disease or cancer, or increase longevity.<br />
								<br />
								One of the areas in which genetic enhancement might
								find initial application is in sports. At the 1964 Winter Olympics in
								Innsbruck, a cross-country skier from Finland who won two gold medals
								was later found to have a genetic mutation that increased the number
								of red blood cells in his body because he could not switch off
								erythropoetin (Epo) production. He did not use HGH. This mutation increased the
								athlete's capacity for aerobic exercise. A synthetic version of
								Epo is currently used to treat anemia, but it has also been abused by
								athletes to heighten their stamina. For example, in the 1998 Tour de
								France, a team was thrown out of the race, and two top cyclists
								admitted taking the drug. Recent efforts to deliver the Epo gene into
								patients' cells would eliminate the need for regular injections,
								but this process could also be abused by athletes.</span></p>
						<p align="left"> <span class="bodytext"><b class="toplinks">Ethical Concerns About HGH</b><br />
							  <br />
							  Genetic enhancement raises a host of ethical, legal
						  and social questions. What is meant by normal? When is a genetic
						  intervention &quot;enhancing&quot; or &quot;therapeutic?&quot; How
						  should the benefit from a genetic enhancement using HGH be calculated in
						  comparing its risks and benefits? Would people who have been
						  genetically enhanced enjoy an unfair advantage in competing for
						  scarce resources? That is, will genetic enhancement be available to
						  all or only to the few who can afford to purchase it using their
						  personal finances? These questions relate to the two major concerns
						  presented by genetic enhancement: the undermining of the principle of
						  social equality and the problem of creating an unfair advantage that
						  would be enjoyed by enhanced individuals.<br />
						  <br />
						  Some have speculated that genetic enhancement through HGH might
						  affect human evolution. Philosophical and religious objections also
						  have been raised, based on the belief that to intervene in such
						  fundamental biological processes is &quot;playing God&quot; or
						  attempting to place us above God. People from various perspectives
						  believe that any interference with the random offerings of nature is
						  inherently wrong and question our right to toy with the product of
						  years of natural selection. Geneticists have countered that the power
						  to control human evolution is unlikely, as the evolution of the human
						  species is a nonrandom change in allelic frequencies resulting from
						  selective pressure. The change progresses over generations because
						  individuals with specific patterns of alleles are favored
						  reproductively. If new alleles were introduced by gene transfer, the
						  impact on the species would be negligible. Moreover, there is no
						  certainty that genetically enhanced individuals would have greater
						  biological fitness, as measured by reproductive success.<br />
							  <br />
						  In general, however, ethical and social concerns
						  center not so much on the improvement of traits for alleviation of
						  deficiencies or on the reduction of disease risk, but on the
						  augmentation of functions that without intervention would be
						  considered entirely normal. For some individuals, technologies that
						  can enhance traits are even more attractive than those that would
						  merely duplicate them (e.g., cloning). And, although the distinctions
						  between cure and enhancement might be obvious to some, they can lose
						  meaning in medical practice or in formulating health policy. For
						  example, interventions that begin in an effort to cure could slide
						  quickly toward interventions that enhance.<br />
							  <br />
							  <br />
							  <b class="toplinks">Regulatory Issues of HGH</b><br />
							  <br />
							  The questions raised above about HGH also create significant new
						  challenges to our regulatory capabilities.&nbsp;<br />
							  <br />
						  On September 11, 1997, the National Institutes of
						  Health (NIH) convened a conference on HGH. The
						  meeting was prompted by a request to NIH to approve a protocol for
						  conducting a gene therapy experiment on healthy volunteers, rather
						  than on patients. Although the experiment was part of an effort to
						  develop treatments for cystic fibrosis, the proposed use of healthy
						  subjects raised, for the first time, the questions of whether and in
						  what circumstances it was appropriate to use gene insertion
						  technology in healthy volunteers. Exactly how to regulate this
						  potential use of genetic technology remains unclear.<br />
							  <br />
							  In order for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
						  control the introduction and use of genetic enhancement technologies,
						  these techniques would have to be considered to be drugs, biologics,
						  or medical devices, categories for which FDA has the authority to
						  regulate genetic enhancements. Regarding drugs used for enhancement
						  purposes, like HGH, the definition of a drug in the Federal Food, Drug, and
						  Cosmetic Act includes not only &quot;articles intended for use in the
						  diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in
						  man&quot; but also &quot;articles (other than food) intended to
						  affect the structure or function of the body of man.&quot; The agency
						  has relied on this definition to assert drug regulatory authority
						  over products such as wrinkle creams and tanning agents that are
						  intended to enhance the appearance of the body but that achieve
						  results by affecting the body's structural or functional components.
						  The agency will be challenged by the need to determine when
						  enhancement is &quot;genetic&quot; (versus nongenetic, for example,
						  liposuction or cosmetic surgery) and when genetic manipulation is
						  &quot;enhancement.&quot; In addition, FDA's ability to regulate
						  HGH in the traditional areas of safety and efficacy
						  will be put to the test by data deficiencies and the subjectivity of
						  judgments about risk and benefit. In addition, enhancement techniques
						  are likely to emerge as unapproved or off-label uses of approved
						  products, uses over which FDA lacks effective regulatory control.</span></p>
