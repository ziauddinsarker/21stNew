					<h1><span class="header1">Inquiry From an NCAA Division I Football Player</span> </h1>
					</div>
				<div>
					<p class="bodytext">I am interested in your HGH oral spray.  First, I should mention that I am a college football player at the Division 1 level, and therefore have to be EXTREMELY careful about the supplements I choose to take due to the frequent drug testing performed by the NCAA. </p>
					<p class="bodytext"> I have done a good bit of research about IGF-1 products through numerous medical databases, and have actually taken one of the deer antler sprays through S.W.A.T.S. and liked it.  However, I have recently heard good reviews on your spray, and would appreciate you taking the time to respond to a few questions that I have. </p>
					<p class="bodytext"> First, do you know if your product is up to par with NCAA drug testing regulations?  I have read that most products are only detectable through blood testing.  Additionally, after looking through many different medical databases, all of the findings state that there is insufficient evidence to support the drugs claims, and that there are no known adverse reactions. </p>
					<p class="bodytext"> Are you aware of any adverse reactions of the supplement, especially in regards to anitibiotics or infections? I am especially interested in your oral spray because I have had a series of serious knee surgeries and am trying to return to the playing  field as quickly as possible.  However,  I'm a bit worried by the fact that the claimed positive effects could actually hinder me in this situation as any infection could be increased through the use of the product or the increased immune system response could possibly attack the foreign tissues from the surgery.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">I would greatly appreciate your response to this email and would love get access to any information you might have that could further answer any of these questions.  As I realize that this request may take a good bit of time, I would like to point out that many of my teammates would also be very interested to learn more about your HGH oral spray, and your detailed response to my questions could earn you a significant amount of additional business in the future.  I appreciate your help.</p>
					<h2><p class="style2">First, do you know if your product is up to par with NCAA drug testing regulations? </p></h2>
					<p class="bodytext">You and your teammates are late to the game. We've been selling our HGH oral apray to Pro and collegiate athletes at all levels for over 12 years. None of our customers have been busted in all that time. Football, baseball, and body builders lead the way. Recently, mixed martial arts, tennis, and soccer players are jumping in.</p>
					<h2><p class="style3">Are you aware of any adverse reactions of the supplement, especially in regards to anitibiotics or infections?</p></h2>
					<p class="bodytext">The only adverse reactions we know of come from HGH injections of improper over dosing or complications using needles. There are no adverse reactions to our homeopathic oral spray. It is very gentle on the system. It's also not a miracle worker. It's a good general tonic. It enhances everything about 10%-20%: strength, endurance, recuperation, mental clarity. So if you use it for healing it will help only about that much. If that much is what you want then spend the money. If not, don't.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Everyone responds to the product differently so some guys using it might leave the machines in the workout room trembling. Some others might not feel that much. We do have a 90 day guarantee so we encourage people to try it out for themselves. That's the only way to know for sure. And we never hassle anyone over refunds. Just keep the old bottles, send them back, and the refund is issued.<br />
					</p>
					<div align="center"><img src="images/greyline.jpg" width="400" height="2" alt="greyline" longdesc="indeximages/greyline.jpg" /></div>
					<p class="bodytext">      I appreciate your quick response to my previous questions.</p>
					<p class="bodytext"> Regarding my previous questions about NCAA drug testing for HGH, besides the fact that &quot;none of our customers have been busted in all that time,&quot; have you submitted your oral spray for any testing by these agencies? </p>
					<p class="bodytext"> I also ran into a couple questions when comparing your HGH oral spray to other products on the market.  For example, Nutronics Labs has an IGF-1 plus supplement claiming to have 70mg of deer antler velvet extract.  On your site, no particular amount is disclosed but rather it states Human Growth Hormone 30X and Deer Antler 6X.  Have you ever done a comparison between the two products? </p>
					<p class="bodytext"> I am favoring your HGH oral spray due to its FDA approval, but was looking for some clarification on the ingredients comparison.  Thanks again.<br />
					</p>
					<h2><p class="style3">...have you submitted your oral spray for any testing by these agencies?</p></h2>
					<p class="bodytext">The agencies, seeing &quot;HGH&quot; as an ingredient, would ban it without testing it.</p>
					<p class="style3">Nutronics Labs has an IGF-1 plus supplement claiming to have 70mg of deer antler velvet extract.  On your site, no particular amount is disclosed but rather it states Human Growth Hormone 30X and Deer Antler 6X.  Have you ever done a comparison between the two products?</p>
					<p class="bodytext">You can't compare them because there's is a supplement and ours is homeopathic. You're trying to compare a car and a plane. Do some research on &quot;homeopathy&quot; and you'll understand better.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">A quick (and insufficient) answer is that in homeopathy you trick your body into thinking it contains certain substances in order to get a particular directed physical response. That's why when an athlete is tested they can't find anything. Meanwhile the body is reacting as if increased amounts of HGH were there. And that's also why homeopathic HGH is so safe.</p>
					<p class="bodytext">Homeopathy has been around for over 200 years, curing all kinds of human maladies. You can have 70 mg of deer antler in you and it might not get the body to do anything. Or you can have much less in you and the body responds like it has much more. The former targets ingestion while the latter targets physical results.</p>
