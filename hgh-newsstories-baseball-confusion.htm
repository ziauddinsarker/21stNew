					<h1><span class="header1">Baseball Reporting Of HGH Is Confusing</span> </h1>
					</div>
				<div>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"><em>News reports on HGH and baseball can be misleading and confusing to the public.&nbsp; The following  are excerpts, highlighted in blue,  from ABC7Chicago.com on 03/01/07. Explanations that clear up the confusion follow in black. </em> </p>
					<p align="left"> <span class="bodytext"><font color="blue">Major League Baseball officials want more information on  allegations the Los Angeles Angels outfielder received human growth hormone  from a pharmacy that's part of a widespread steroid investigation.&quot;We're  looking into it,&quot; baseball spokesman Rich Levin said Thursday. &quot;I  know our people are going to contact the Albany district attorney.&quot;</font></span></p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"> The problem with this lead paragraph is the unintended  link of human growth hormone and steroids.&nbsp;  It's use is not permitted by Major League Baseball.&nbsp; But HGH is not a steroid.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like any other prescribed drug.&nbsp; If you have a prescription it&rsquo;s not illegal  to own or to use.&nbsp; This same  pharmaceutical substance is contained in all homeopathic  preparations and is  perfectly legal for over the counter sales as its been approved in this form by  the FDA.&nbsp; Many athletes are using  homeopathic  oral spray for this reason.&nbsp;  There is no test for it so baseball players need to be caught actually  spraying the substance or admitting to it&rsquo;s use.</p>
					<p align="left"> <span class="bodytext"><font color="blue">Four more people are expected to surrender in Albany,  N.Y., on Monday as part of the investigation into an illicit steroid  distribution network that may be responsible for Internet sales of  performance-enhancing drugs nationwide. Though Matthews, former baseball star  Jose Canseco and former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield were reportedly  among the customers, district attorney P. David Soares has repeatedly said  physicians and distributors, not users, are his focus.</font></span></p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"> DA Soares is targeting &ldquo;physicians and distributors&rdquo;  which is an excellent idea.&nbsp; Internet  sales of illegal steroids is a menace to society and dangerous to the health of  humans in general.&nbsp; Realistically, he  won&rsquo;t have any success stopping doctors, unless they are handing out  HGH prescriptions illegally.&nbsp; But he will be  able to stop HGH distributors, especially online vendors.</p>
					<p align="left"> <span class="bodytext"><font color="blue">An Albany County grand jury also has indicted the two  owners of Applied Pharmacy Services in Mobile, Ala., according to the Times  Union of Albany, which first disclosed the investigation. Matthews, Canseco and  Holyfield allegedly were on Applied Pharmacy's customer list, the Times Union  said. And SI.com reported that Matthews was sent Genotropin, a brand of  synthetic growth hormone, in August 2004.The drug, which came from Applied  Pharmacy, was sent to the address in Mansfield, Texas, of one of Matthews'  former minor league teammates, according to the Internet site. Matthews has  declined to answer specific questions about the allegations.&quot;</font></span></p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"> Again, Genotropin which is  pharmaceutical HGH that is injected, is not illegal unless the pharmacy sent it  out without a doctor&rsquo;s proper and legal prescription.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same thing as if the pharmacy was shipping out narcotics  to people without prescriptions.&nbsp; The  linkage that human growth hormone is as bad as steroids or even narcotics can  be easily and wrongly associated by the general public.&nbsp; This is true as well for the over the  counter and perfectly legal homeopathic oral sprays.</p>
					<p align="left"> <span class="bodytext"><font color="blue">HGH is a rarely prescribed drug whose legal uses have to  be specifically approved by the Health and Human Services secretary. But it's  become popular on the black market with people looking to gain strength or  reverse the aging process.</font></span></p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext"> The Health and Human Services secretary has approved human growth hormone to treat dwarfism  and other obscure diseases.&nbsp; But doctors  often prescribe all kinds of drugs to cure diseases or other illnesses that  particular drugs are not specifically approved to treat.&nbsp; This is common practice.&nbsp; Many doctors in private practice have set up  anti-aging institutes that prescribe human growth hormone therapies with carefully controlled  protocols for their clients.&nbsp; There have been over 1700 studies done on the  effects of injectible, pharmaceutical, human growth hormone and yet the FDA has never  approved the hormone for anti-aging.&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s only &ldquo;black market&rdquo; if HGH is not prescribed.&nbsp; Homeopathic  HGH oral sprays do not need  prescriptions as they are approved by the FDA for over-the-counter sales.&nbsp; They only achieve 60%-80% of the rise in  IGF-1 levels that injections achieve, but the cost is far lower and the Feds  won&rsquo;t be beating down your door.</p>
					<p align="left"> <span class="bodytext"><font color="blue">The Albany case -- along with a similar investigation by  federal prosecutors in Rhode Island -- are a shift in the fight against doping.  Testing may expose athletes who cheat, but it does little to deter those who  make, market and distribute performance-enhancing </font></span><span class="style9"><font color="blue">substances. Stopping</font></span><span class="bodytext"><font color="blue"> the flow  of drugs requires punishing the sources -- something sports agencies can't do.</font></span></p>
					<h2><p align="left" class="toplinks">HGH is NOT a Steroid </p></h2>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Those reading this article might assume that human growth  hormone is &ldquo;dope&rdquo; or that it is part of the steroid family.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not.&nbsp;  The inclusion of HGH in this grouping is misleading to the public.&nbsp; And whether human growth hormone enhances performances or not  is something that remains to be proven.&nbsp;  But pharmaceutical HGH injections, properly prescribed by a licensed physician, is  not illegal.&nbsp; Currently there is no test  that shows human growth hormone in the system although the above paragraph  implies that there is.&nbsp; There are tests  for steroids and narcotics.&nbsp; </p>
					<p align="left" class="bodytext">Just as  pharmaceutical HGH is several steps away from steroids and narcotics,  homeopathic oral sprays are several steps away from pharmaceutical injections.&nbsp; All homeopathic remedies, whether they be  for allergies, flu symptoms, menopause or what-have-you, are extremely safe and  gentle on the system. So it makes sense that many athletes are turning to it as  an edge in their performance particularly since it is perfectly legal to  purchase over the counter at any health food store or online provider.</p>
